# Vue-Breaking-Bad-API

This is my first vue project. It was a project I saw on YouTube done by TraversyMedia but instead he used React. To get familiar with Vue I did the project with the framework. In addition, I needed some experience with APIs so this broject was a good first.

I would like to say thanks to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course on Vue, Brad Travery for doing the project on YouTube, Tim Biles who is the creator of the API and also a user on stackoverflow named S. Graham who assisted me in solving the searching of the API. Wihtout these individuals this project would have never been done and I wouldn't have learnt some of the basic of Vue.
